# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
## Made by Madison Scercy

This is a project where I took starter code, and made it generate a randomized password. I cannot talk about this project without mentioning my tutor, Bobbi Tarkany, who helped me immensely in this project. I learned a lot about javascript with her help. In this project, I used arrays, functions, and loops to execute the code into generating a password from different characters. When entering the page, the user is prompted to select a length for their password, and then choose the types of characters they want to include in it. They are numbers, special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters. After the needed criteria is met, the password will be generated.
